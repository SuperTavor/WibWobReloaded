# FaQ
## What exactly is WibWob Reloaded?
The original wibwob shut down in 2018, so we took the original game and massively modified it to work without a server.
## On what platforms will I be able to play this?
Android.
## When will this mod be releasing?
Because of the recent incident with the Puni Translation Project, this project was created with a "no stress" principal in mind. No release date yet.
## Can I transfer my data from Puni?
no, but WibWob Reloaded and Puni can coexist on the same device.
## Will Ranks From Puni Ever Be Added? (SSS, Z, etc)
We don't know yet, but probably not.
## Will There be events?
yes! we will loop old wibwob events and even make custom ones!
## how does this revival work?
we are taking wibwob and turning it offline with epic smali editing
# is this like the Puni Translation Project?
No, this is a full revival of Yo-Kai Watch Wibble Wobble, not a translation for puni (but this project was started by some of the puni translation devs)
